The idea of this shelter for travelers has been taken as spaces that curate one’s experience from outside to inside through something which is in-between conventional Outside/ inside typology.
While it may make sense to create a fully transparent glasshouse to open the cabin towards the view of northern lights, it takes away the opportunity to feel the sense of enclosure by letting the architecture spill out of the volume.

It does not provide a space to withdraw from nature to appreciate nature.

The openings in walls are two-dimensional planes which creates the definition of inside and outside, to blur this boundary the cottages provide mediating spaces that create the illusion of being outside yet is also part of the inside.

The two choices of cottages are inspired by the traditional Goahti Sami Huts and elevated storage units in Sami villages.

One tries to push back the earth with its weight to create the biological need of protecting one’s back while opening towards the dancing lights of the sky above. The projecting alcoves are windows & doors which try to create the in-between spaces through volumetric projection rather than defining with planar punctures.

While the other one, instead of scooping out the ground, extends itself towards the opposite side. The room is essentially a glass house to let the space leak out but the projecting balconies recapture the escaped architecture and create the in-between space which is partially closed from the outside through vertical louvers, the punctures in the roof connect the space with the sky above.

The public spaces are also variations of the above two mentioned typologies. With varied types of response to the context of sloping ground and dense vegetation it is attempted to create the ambiance of primitive Sami village in middle of the Scandinavian natural heritage.
