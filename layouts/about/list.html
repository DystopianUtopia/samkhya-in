    <p class="about-info">
      In Hindu philosophy, Samkhya sees reality as the interaction of two fundamental principles:
      <br><br>
      Purusha (Consciousness) and Prakriti (Nature).
      <br><br>
      Purusha represents the observer, the conscious self, while Prakriti represents the material world.
      For us the simplification of Prakriti is the surrounding environment we inhabit.
      We believe that architecture, at its core, is the manifestation of this relationship — between humanity and the built environment.
      <br><br>
      Samkhya was founded with a deep interest in the critical inquiry of this interaction: how Consciousness and Nature shape and define the spaces we live in.
      At the heart of our practice is the belief that architecture is not about the mere production of design, but rather about the ongoing investigation into the phenomena of space-making. We seek to understand how we perceive, experience, and engage with the built environment. This inquiry is not about arriving at a final form, but about the continuous exploration of how spaces shape our lives and interactions.
      
      We approach architecture as a dynamic process, one rooted in reflection, questioning, and investigation. Through this lens, we see architecture as a living inquiry—a search for understanding, a reflection on how spaces and environments influence and transform us.
